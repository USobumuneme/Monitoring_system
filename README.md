# Deep Learning-Based Health Risk Prediction in Contact Sports Using Wearable Sensor Data

# Abstract
This study presents a deep learning-based approach to predicting physiological health risks in athletes engaged in contact sports using wearable sensor data. Motivated by the need to detect early warning signs of collapse or severe fatigue, this study employs a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to analyse multivariate time-series data. Key physiological signals, including heart rate, body temperature, and motion, were extracted from the PAMAP2 dataset to train and validate the model. The LSTM demonstrated strong predictive performance, achieving an accuracy of 98.3% in identifying potentially dangerous physiological states. In addition to its high classification accuracy, the model effectively captured temporal dependencies in the data, underscoring its suitability for health risk prediction in dynamic, high-intensity sports environments. This study highlights the potential of wearable data and LSTM-based analysis in supporting proactive athlete health management and injury prevention.
